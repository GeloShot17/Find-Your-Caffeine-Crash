## How it works

The first couple fields asks for user body weight and how much caffeine they ingested in milligrams. The backbone of the calculations revolves around the idea that a persons maximum daily caffiene intake is equal to 6 mg per 1 kg of body weight. From here a person's minimum effective dose is somewhere between a quarter to a third of this measurement. Time calculation is then done utilizing caffeine decay rate in the body.
